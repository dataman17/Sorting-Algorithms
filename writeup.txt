Using the Dash-oh option (-O) the values of addresses and sizes did not change and below is the data. The first section is without the -O and the second
section is with the -O option but they are identical.  Finding the locations of the subroutines from stdio.h and stdlib.h, the two libraries I included,
proved to be the most challenging. In the end, and after collaboration with CSAC and a CS Professor, I have decided that the libraries are included
at runtime using linking.  Therefore their addresses are 0x00 because they are not saved in memory. This makes sense because you would not want the whole
 library if you were only going to use a single function.  If you link it at runtime you can just grab the single function and use it.
